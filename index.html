                <h2>Wat Arun: The Temple of Dawn</h2>
                <p>
                    Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan or Wat Arun is a Buddhist temple in Bangkok Yai district of Bangkok, Thailand, on the Thonburi west bank of the Chao Phraya River. The temple derives its name from the Hindu god Aruna, often personified as the radiations of the rising sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main feature of Wat Arun is its central prang (Khmer-style tower) which is encrusted with colorful porcelain. This is interpreted as a stupa-like pagoda encrusted with colored faience. The height is reported by different sources as between 66.8 m (219 ft) and 86 m (282 ft).
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is one of Thailand's best known landmarks and the first light of the morning reflects off the surface of the temple with pearly iridescence. Although the temple had existed since at least the seventeenth century, its distinctive prang was built in the early nineteenth century during the reign of King Rama II and Rama III.
